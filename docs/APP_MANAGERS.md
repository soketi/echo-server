# Implementing App Managers

Apps are used to allow access to clients, as well as to be able to securely publish events to your users by using signatures generated by app secret.

## Default Application

Echo Server comes with a single default app whose data can be changed using `APP_DEFAULT_*` environment variables, as explained in the [Environment Variables docs](ENV.md#default-application).

The default driver is called `array`. From this array, when someone connects, an app will be check just like [https://pusher.com](Pusher) does. If it does not exists, no connection can be made.

You might use the `APP_DEFAULT_*` variables to set the default app details, or you can specifiy a JSON-serialized list of apps with `APPS_LIST` that will override the `APP_DEFAULT_*` variables.

## HTTP API Driver

However, you might want to store multiple apps in a dynamic & controlled manner and not locally. The `api` driver comes in place to help with that. You can specify the host, endpoint and a verification token that can make requests on Echo Server's behalf and retrieve the apps from another server via a HTTP request.

In Laravel, you can use [soketi/echo-server-core](https://github.com/soketi/echo-server-core), and extend the functionality for the `api` driver by storing the apps into database. It comes out-of-the-box with migrations and models, as well as the controller needed, so you can immediately extend the core functionality for Echo Server.

### Implementing your own API Driver

If you decide to implement your own API handler, you should expose an endpoint on your webserver. This route is by default `/echo-server/app`, and can be modified by `APPS_MANAGER_ENDPOINT`.

In the [Environment Variables doc](ENV.md#apps-manager), you will find variables to set the host, endpoint and verification token that Echo Server will request the app from.

All parameters sent are in the query string.

Take a look on how this is implemented in Echo Server Core:

```php
class AppsController extends Controller
{
    use AuthorizesRequests, DispatchesJobs, ValidatesRequests;

    /**
     * Initialize the controller.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function __construct()
    {
        // Check if the given ?token=... is correct.
        $this->middleware(AuthenticatesWithToken::class);
    }

    /**
     * Get an app by ID.
     *
     * @param  \Soketi\EchoServer\Contracts\AppsManager  $appsManager
     * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request
     * @return \Illuminate\Http\Response
     */
    public function show(AppsManager $appsManager, Request $request)
    {
        if ($request->appId) { // Check if ?appId=... is present to retrieve app by ID.
            $app = $appsManager->findById($request->appId);
        } elseif ($request->appKey) { // Check if ?appKey=... is present to retrieve app by ID.
            $app = $appsManager->findByKey($request->appKey);
        } else {
            $app = null; // Invalidate the request.
        }

        // Throw 404 if app is not found.
        if (! $app) {
            return response()->json(['app' => null], 404);
        }

        // Send the app with the `app` key.
        return response()->json([
            'app' => $app->toArray(),
        ]);
    }
}
```

An example response looks like this, and the structure must be maintained:

```json
{
    "app": {
        "id": 1,
        "key": "echo-app-key",
        "secret": "echo-app-secret",
        "maxConnections": 100,
        "enableStats": false,
        "enableClientMessages": true,
        "maxBackendEventsPerMinute": -1,
        "maxClientEventsPerMinute": -1,
        "maxReadRequestsPerMinute": -1
    }
}
```

**You should not fear the secrets are being exposed. As long as the authentication is secured by the token, all handling for the app is internal-only!**
